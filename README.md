# Fake News Detection System

Welcome to the Fake News Detection System, a project aimed at identifying and classifying news articles as either real or fake. This system utilizes various Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn's model selection, and metrics.

## Getting Started

To set up the Fake News Detection System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Dataset:**
   - Obtain a dataset containing labeled news articles (real or fake).
   - Place the dataset file (e.g., `news_dataset.csv`) in the project directory.

4. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Update the `preprocess_data.py` script with the appropriate file paths and preprocessing steps.
   - Run the script to prepare the data for training.

5. **Train the Model:**
   - Update the `train_model.py` script with the necessary configurations.
   - Run the script to train the fake news detection model.

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Execute the `evaluate_model.py` script to assess the model's performance using various metrics.

7. **Visualize Results:**
   - Explore the `visualize_results.py` script for visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- `preprocess_data.py`: Data preprocessing script.
- `train_model.py`: Model training script using Scikit-learn.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Model evaluation script with performance metrics.
- `visualize_results.py`: Visualization script using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries and versions required.

## Usage

- Adjust configurations in the scripts according to your dataset and preferences.
- Run each script sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize results.
